# Sudoku

This program is designed to solve Project Euler's problem #96
Can be used to solve any Sudoku state
I'm mostly making this to understand the branching algorithm I'm implementing
NOTE: May take awhile, will return only the first solution it finds
Liable to give errors if not formatted correctly
Currently does not check if initial board state is illegal
